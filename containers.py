"""
I am learning about 3 commonly used containers: lista, tuples, and dictionary
"""

# Create a list of your favorite musicians

musicians = ["Rico Nasty", "Lucky Daye", "Mac Miller", "Solange"]
print(musicians)

# Create a list of tuples, with each tuple containing the longitude and latitude of
# somewhere you've lived or visited
locations = ("Townley Apartments", "23V2+V8 Beltsville, District 1, Vansville, MD")
print(locations)

# Create a dictionary that contains different attributes about you: height,
# favorite color, favorite author, etc.
Bola = {"Height":
        "5'4",
        "Favorite Color":
        "Yellow",
        "Favorite Animal":
        "Giraffe"
        }
print(Bola)

# Write a program that lets the user ask yout height, favorite color, or author,
# and returns the result from the dictionary you created in the previous challenge

# Create a dictionary mapping your favorite musicians to a list of your favorite
# songs by them

#Lists, tuples, and dictionaries are just a few of the containers built into Python
#. Research Python sets(a type of container). When would you use a set?
